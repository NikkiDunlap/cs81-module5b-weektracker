Reflection

Were your predictions accurate?
For the most part, yes. I guessed that my Thursday “Coding Practice” session would score the highest in enjoyment, and it did with a perfect 10. I also expected creative activities to dominate the week, and three out of seven entries were creative, making that prediction accurate. However, I thought evenings would blow the other time slots away in enjoyment, but mornings were a close second—so that part was only partially true.

What surprised you about your week?
I was surprised by how much enjoyment I got from short sessions. My Monday morning run was under an hour but still scored a 9, almost matching longer activities. I also didn’t realize social activities like the Saturday beach hangout would rack up three full hours; I usually feel like I don’t have that much free time. Seeing the numbers broke that assumption.

Which higher-order function was most useful and why?
`filter` turned out to be the MVP. It let me slice the data in so many ways—physical versus creative, high-enjoyment versus low-enjoyment, morning versus evening—without rewriting loops. Chaining `filter` with `reduce` (to total hours) or `map` (to reformat results) gave me quick insights and kept the code readable. It’s a pattern I can reuse in bigger projects when I need fast, flexible data analysis.
